Problem Statement:
Parents who have 4 to 10 years of children find it difficult to help their children to socialize in their neighborhood.

Elaboration: 
Parents who have 4 to 10 years old children find it difficult to help their children socialize when their children are feeling bored. This makes them feel dizzy,  less energetic,  unsocialized, and introverted. When children are home most of the time (Summer holidays/ Weekends/ After school).

In urban areas, people are oblivious to their neighbors and are introverted enough to not make many friends beyond their colleagues or talk to other people if not absolutely necessary. This becomes a problem for new parents where the social circle of their kids is extremely limited to their parent’s friends and their kids if any. This makes it difficult for them to “go out and play” thus clinging to video games and TV. Kids in this urban jungle may not be able to find friends that live nearby them due to safety concerns of their parents that cannot be overlooked.

This brings us to our website where we are building an application that will allow parents of kids to find other kids of the same age and have activities and playtime allowing their kids to find friends out of the close circle.
